# localcider_table_annotator

An extremely simple (and crude) wrapper to annotate a table of sequences with localCIDER features.

all credit goes to the localCIDER package (https://pappulab.github.io/localCIDER/, https://github.com/Pappulab/localCIDER) and its authors. This is just a simple wrapper to annotate a table with localCIDER features.


It almost shouldn't be a repo, but I keep needing to use this in various projects, so I made a repo for it.


## installation

run `make` to see available commands.

to install the project, run:
- `make create_environment` to create a conda environment with the required dependencies.
    - make sure to then activate the environment with `conda activate localcider_table_annotator`
- `make requirements` to update the environment packages (if needed)
